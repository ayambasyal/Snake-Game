# Snake Game
 Implementation of Classic Snake game using SFML

Snake game is a classic video game that has been popular for decades. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around a playing field, eating food while avoiding obstacles. As the snake eats food, its body grows longer, making it harder to maneuver without hitting a wall or the snake's own body.

In this particular implementation of the Snake game, SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is used as a graphics library and C++ is used as the programming language. SFML is a cross-platform multimedia library that provides easy access to windowing, graphics, audio, and networking capabilities. It is a popular choice for game development because it is easy to use and has a straightforward API.

This basic Snake game implementation using SFML in C++ provides an excellent starting point for learning game development. It is a great example of how simple games can be created using basic programming concepts and a few libraries.
